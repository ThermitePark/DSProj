## Polynomial Addition (C++)

This project implements **Polynomial addition** in C++.

Each polynomial is stored as a list of `(coefficient, exponent)` terms.  
Terms with the same exponent are **Combined** during addition.  
Zero-coefficient terms can be removed in the final result.

You must enter the terms in descending order of exponent.
Example: 3  3.0 5  2.0 3  -4.0 0 => $3x^5 + 2x^3 -4 $

### TXT file I/O
