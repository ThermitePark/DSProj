# Data Structures Projects (C++)

This repository contains a set of C++ projects that apply key concepts from university-level Data Structures courses.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to turn theoretical data structure knowledge into practical, working projects.  
Each project focuses on choosing appropriate data structures, implementing them cleanly, and understanding performance trade-offs.

## Technical Focus

These projects emphasize modern C++ software design and implementation practices, including:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to structure code into clear, reusable components
- Templates to build generic, type-safe data structures and algorithms
- Clean interfaces and modular design for maintainability and extensibility

## Outcome

By implementing and applying data structures through real projects, this repository aims to strengthen problem-solving skills and broaden perspective on how fundamental concepts translate into scalable software design.
